# Phylogeny
This code aligns protein sequences which can then be used to generate a basic phylogenetic tree which is exported it in to phyloXML format so the tree can be visualised using other phylogenetic software. 

Example data is provided and contains the protein sequences of CRN homologues from various wheat species and Arabidopsis and maize which act as an outgroup. 

To run:
1. Create a single directory with your protein sequences of interest and the MUSCLE binary which can be downloaded from (https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)
2. For sample data download FASTA file into this directory
3. Align the protein sequences you want to investigate:
```
# code block
print '3 backticks or'
print 'indent 4 spaces'
```
